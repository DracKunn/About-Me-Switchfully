      <p class="text">
        I am Brecht, passionate about people and informatics. <br />
        <br />
        My dad is a system engineer and my mom is a psychologist. <br />
        I grew up with computers, playing video games, thinking about how games
        influence behaviour and how behaviour influences code. I think it's
        amazing how humanity has built virtual worlds whose rules are dictated
        by how we think.

        TEKsystems: <br />
        As a recruiter for open-source system engineers I got to talk to a lot
        of professionals. Not just system engineers but project managers,
        developers, testers etc. I loved exploring the vast world of IT in
        Belgium through these conversations. It was easy for me to take genuine
        interest in their jobs. I realised I wanted what they had. <br />
        After a year I started coding html on an app called mimo, where I also
        got a taste of python, PHP, CSS and JavaScript.
        <br /><br />
        Canada:<br />
        I went to Work and travel in Canada with my girlfriend (now wife). I had
        tim to think about which direction to take with carreer. I tried tried
        security on Udemy as well as python for data science.

      <p class="text">
        After Canada I looked into various jobs and training programs and found
        Switchfully. By then I knew I wanted to code programs. I wanted to be a
        backend developer. <br />
        When comparing .NET and Java, the most popular languages I chose Java
        because of the companies that use it. EG: Colruyt.
        <br />
        I'm now learing JavaScript to stay learning as it is also an object
        oriented programming language and used for many websites.

      <h1 class="heading">Where I'm going</h1>
      <p class="text">
        I plan to be a junior java enterprise developer by q4 working in a
        medium to large environment to learn and improve my skills. Taking on
        any project that helps my company.
        <br />
        Switchfully is the best road towards this goal as they work with
        top-tier companies such as Colruyt, FOD Fin and FOD Economie. Colruyt
        especially is of interest to me as I've always been a fan of their brand
        and way of working. <br />
        As a psychology student I got to know them as an excellent employer.<br />
        As a recruiter I got to know them as an excellent IT environment.<br />
        Colruyt has always been on my radar and this will not change. Frankly,
        if I don't get through with switchfully I'm certain I'll work for them
        through another channel 😊.
