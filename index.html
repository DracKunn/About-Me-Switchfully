        👨<br />
        I am Brecht, passionate about people and informatics. <br />

        👫 <br />
        My dad is a system engineer and my mom is a psychologist. <br />
        🖱️ <br />
        I grew up with computers, playing video games, thinking about how games
        influence behaviour and how behaviour influences code. I think it's
        amazing how humanity has built virtual worlds whose rules are dictated
        by how we think. <br />
        ✈️ <br />
        I love to travel and experience how people live in different settings.

        💻 TEKsystems: <br />
        As a recruiter for open-source system engineers I got to talk to a lot
        of professionals. Not just system engineers but project managers,
        developers, testers etc. I loved exploring the vast world of IT in
        Belgium through these conversations. It was easy for me to take genuine
        interest in their jobs. I realised I wanted what they had. <br />
        After a year I started coding html on an app called mimo, where I also
        got a taste of python, PHP, CSS and JavaScript.
        <br /><br />
        🍁 Canada:<br />
        I went to Work and travel in Canada with my girlfriend (now wife). I had
        time to think about which direction to take with my career. I tried
        security on Udemy as well as python for data science.

      <p class="text">
        🔎<br />After Canada I looked into various jobs and training programs
        and found Switchfully. By then I knew I wanted to code programs. I want
        to be a backend developer. <br />
        When comparing .NET and Java, two of the most popular languages, I chose
        Java because of the companies that use it. EG: Colruyt.
        <br />
        📖<br />I'm now leaning JavaScript to keep growing my skills as it is
        also an object oriented programming language and used for many websites.

      <h1 class="heading">Where I'm going</h1>
      <p class="text">
        🪴<br />I want a life where I can face new challenges every day. Where I
        get to work my way through complex problems whilst keeping the bigger
        picture in mind. I believe software development is this life. <br />
        👨‍💻 <br />
        I plan to be a junior java enterprise developer by Q4 2022 working in a
        medium to large environment to learn and improve my skills. Taking on
        any project that helps my company.
        <br />
        Switchfully is the best road towards this goal as they work with
        top-tier companies such as Colruyt, FOD Fin and FOD Economie.
        <br />
        🛒 <br />
        Colruyt especially is of interest to me as I've always been a fan of
        their brand and way of working. <br />
        - As a psychology student I got to know them as one of the most
        excellent employers in Belgium.<br />
        - As a recruiter I got to know them as a great IT environment.<br />
        - Colruyt has always been on my radar and this will not change.
